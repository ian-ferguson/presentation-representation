projectDescription: "I designed a display system consisting of three key components. There are two types of connectors that can join iron pipes together, allowing you to create various shapes. Whether it's simple geometric forms or complex structures, these connectors offer exceptional flexibility. Additionally, there is a clip component that can securely hold paper, fabric, or wires, providing excellent flexibility as well. This display system is designed to enable users to easily construct and adjust the shape and function of the display stand, meeting a wide range of display needs."
