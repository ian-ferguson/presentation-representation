projectDescription: "The display system enables standardized (RAL GZ 638) cellar grids to be connected to a leg structure via a expanding connector. The focus is on a flexible arrangement, whereby the position and angularity of the legs are not defined. This makes it possible to use different grid geometries as display, hanging or storage surfaces. The tool blocks, currently accentuated in orange, make it possible to highlight exhibited objects or suspend them in the hanging system simply by snapping them into place. For this purpose, thin cords can be attached to the underside and a flexible arrangement in the hanging grid can be selected.
