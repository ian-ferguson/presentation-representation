projectDescription: "JOURNEY is a modular display system designed for creating rounded-shaped
structures in exhibition spaces. The system features both curved and
straight rail units, allowing for the formation of various shapes. The O
and C displays slide along the rails, following the curved directions.
The entire structure is supported by tube feet, ensuring stability.
The display elements are made of wood, cut with a CNC cutter and
finished with a primer and glossy white lacquer. The rail tubes are made
of steel, bent and welded for precision. The feet are constructed from
tubular and sheet metal, and both elements are coated with acrylic black
paint."
