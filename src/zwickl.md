projectDescription: "Is an exhibition system designed to be able to showcase different objects. Its main characteristic is that the exhibited objects are mounted on a stick or sticks. The system is easily set up and down by removing the bottom parts and the initial extra holding elements. Small cut-outs on the sticks can be added later as well if necessary."
