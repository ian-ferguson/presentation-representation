projectDescription: "OVER is an exhibition system that lets the exhibition pieces float over their context. Connected to but still elevated from it. Laser cut or bent acrylic glass gives additional opportunities for exhibitions. A hammer seems to have forcefully deformed the plate itâ€˜s presented on.
Four thin wooden legs and four horizontal connection parts make up the frame of the pedestal. This way the size is drastically reduced for transportation. Two leg lengths and two connector lengths give six options for pedestal sizes.
Precise cutouts create sleek slot connections without screws or extra parts. The assembly and disassembly of the exhibition pedestals is therefor fast and easy. 
A screw mechanism attaches the presentation plates to the frame. This way different materials can be used adapting the system to each individual object or the aesthetic of an exhibition.
