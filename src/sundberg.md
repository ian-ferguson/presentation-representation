projectDescription: "Frame is a display system built on a rectangular frame with L-profile legs attaching to its corners. The size of the frame has been based on fitting a 24 inches screen inside of it. Integration of a screen adds many possibilities to enrich the displayed item through different media such as text, videos, sound, photography and animations.

The system has been produced in a lacquered OSB which is a strong, lightweight and cost efficient material. Overall, Frame offers flexibility as it can easily be enlarged by attaching multiple frames to each other. The assembly is fast and effortless as all parts connect with the same type of hexagon socket head cap screw."
